`The design above is the final design where I have used tools such as: PictureBox, TextBox in order to design it. `

### Functionality

Below you can see some methods which helps us to give rules for our game. For example, gameTimerEvent() function will help us to move our pipes while we play also helps us to determine when to end game. If our bird's border crosses any of the pipe's border or ground's border our program will call endGame() method where the program stops the timer to finish it.
